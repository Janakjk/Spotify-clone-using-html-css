Features:
Sidebar Navigation: The left sidebar features icons and text for key navigation items such as Home, Search, Your Library, and a section for custom playlists. This was achieved using a combination of Flexbox for alignment and CSS Grid for structure, ensuring a consistent layout across different screen sizes.



Main Content Area: The central part of the page showcases album covers, playlists, and song lists. I used CSS Grid to create a grid layout that adapts to various screen widths, maintaining the aesthetic appeal of the content. Hover effects were added to album covers and song titles for a dynamic user experience.


Playback Control Panel: The bottom section of the page includes playback controls, such as play/pause buttons, volume control, and progress bar. This section was styled using Flexbox for proper alignment and responsiveness. I also incorporated custom icons and buttons to closely match Spotify's design.
